* These files demonstrate 3 ways to include javascript in a webpage:
1. inline (not recommended) in the body of a webpage https://github.com/ccsu-te350/JS1/blob/master/apply-javascript-external.html
2. internal / in-page - in a <script> element in the <head> section of the page with the </script> closing tag just before the </head> closing tag [apply-javascript-internal.html]
3. external - using an external .js file, referenced by the webpage via <script src="myscript.js"></script> [apply-javascript-external.html]
